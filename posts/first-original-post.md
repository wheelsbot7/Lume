Hey this is a good post with _italics_ and **bold** text ~~and strikethrough~~ text it's so cool I wish it was better though, and by that I mean I wish I knew how to use it. I do really like teh speed at which I can make changes and it updates though. That didn't really happen with the fresh framework. I guess it's doing a lot more work behind the scenes, so it makes sense. All this does is write html based on a script that translates from markdown. I guess it's a little more complicated than that, but that's the basic gist of it really.

If I add a second paragraph, is that still visible in the post card?

Hmmmm

How far down can I go?
