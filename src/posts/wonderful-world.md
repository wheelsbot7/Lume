I love it when names have a deeper meaning behind them, both linguistically and conceptually. Those entymology charts in online dictionaries always fascinated me, like little maps of interpretation. Conceptually, I have SCP-4000 to thank for my love of name-based magic. Oh, sorry I meant to say <span style='color:green;'>THAT ONE PLACE WITH THE FAIRIES IN A FOREST THAT CAN'T BE REFERED TO WITH THE SAME NAME TWICE</span>
