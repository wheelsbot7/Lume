There's a bit of filler text that I've seen used a lot in website templates. Don't bother reading it, it's all gibberish, but here's a good snippet:

<p style='font-size: small; line-height: 50%'>Leverage agile frameworks to provide a robust synopsis for high level overviews. <span style='font-size: smaller'>Iterative approaches to corporate strategy foster collaborative thinking to further the overall value proposition. <span style='font-size: smaller'>Organically grow the holistic world view of disruptive innovation via workplace diversity and empowerment. <span style='font-size: smaller'>Bring to the table win-win survival strategies to ensure proactive domination. <span style='font-size: smaller'>At the end of the day, going forward, a new normal that has evolved from generation X is on the runway heading towards a streamlined cloud solution. <span style='font-size: smaller'>User generated content in real-time will have multiple touchpoints for offshoring. Capitalize on low hanging fruit to identify a ballpark value added activity to beta test. Override the digital divide with additional clickthroughs from DevOps. Nanotechnology immersion along the information highway will close the loop on focusing solely on the bottom line.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

Your eyes glaze over after the first sentence, right? It's mind-numbing. Deliberately so, I should add. It uses buzzwords that rely on context for meaning, but doesn't provide any. Perfect filler text despite being 100% grammatically correct. But that first sentence stuck with me because it's shockingly close to how web frameworks market themselves. 

They always try to paint themselves as the only product you'll need for web development in a way that appeals to business types, but overwhelms anyone who might be interested in actually _using_ it. Should we be worried that the most powerful people in our society respond best to nonsense word salad that _eludes_ to something valuable? Probably, but that can't be solved with a blog post, so instead I'll try to demistify some of the marketing-speak that surrounds frameworks, JavaScript, and web development in general.

## But Seriously, What's a Framework?

At its most basic level, a framework is a collection of tools that developers use to create and run software on a specific platform. A good example of this that ironically has nothing to do with the internet is Microsoft's .NET Framework. Funnily enough, Microsoft **also** had a hard time explaining what .NET was or why you should want it. So much so that they [gave up after 3 years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_.NET_strategy).

In retrospect it's hard to see why Microsoft saw value in pushing .NET to the consumer in the first place. Not only was it extremely confusing for those without extensive knowledge of the Windows operating system, it was always meant to be invisible to the end user.
